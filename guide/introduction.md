In my experience, the following describes the most significant challenges in software engineering:

1. **Technology**: Building the software system.
2. **Business**: Building the right system (move the right business metrics).
3. **Process**: Building the system efficiently (on budget and time).

In each section, you will find topics that I think are most useful in facing those challenges.
