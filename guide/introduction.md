title: Introduction to the software developer guide
permalink: introduction.html
---

After working with software professionally for some time, I learned that there are three biggest challenges for developers:

1. Building the system that is robust, maintainable and flexible (quality software).
2. Building the right system in the first place (affect the right business metrics).
3. Building the system on budget and time.

In this book, you will learn about techniques, practices and methodologies that help us face the above challenges. Note that I did not invent these ideas. I just picked the ones that help with the listed challenges.

--------------------------------------------
_Why did you write this book?_

I wrote this book to summarize and share what I've learned so far as a professional developer. I think that it might be useful to others.

_Write the introduction for someone new to software engineering. Maybe say how you started your career very green and so on._

_Why they should read this book?_

They should read this book because it presents solutions to the most common problems in software engineering. If they read it, they will be better prepared to tackle these problems and make their lives as developers easier and their projects successful.

_Introduce the concepts that the book presents_

Mention that the book focuses on helping you to become an expert in your technology, to be goal/business oriented and to deliver result quickly.

_Present your initial argument._

I state the half of all IT projects fails and we, developers, are responsible for it to a certain degree. My argument is that to do our best, as developers, we need to follow the ideas presented in this book.

_Say what your topic is, why it is important and how I plan to proceed with my discussion._

My topic is about an excellence in software engineering, it is important because we suck at this according to the stats. I will proceed with my discussion by describing problems and their solutions.

_After reading the intro, readers should not have surprises when the read the body._
