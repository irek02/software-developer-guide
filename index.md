In this Software Developer Guide, you will learn how to:

## Build high-quality solutions that are robust, performant and maintainable

I made many stupid mistakes while learning how to build sound solutions, but you do not have to repeat them. In this book, I will show what you need to know to write high quality code. This means you will be able to implement the best technical solution using essential developer tools, practices and principles, architecture design and the right platform stack.

## Build the right solution for the right problem

Statistically, IT organizations fail half of their projects*. One of the reasons for this is that we, developers, focus solely on the technology aspect of the project and lose the sense of its business purpose. I learned it the hard way by wasting my time on building useless features and redoing somebody else’s work. Why can’t we deliver the right thing before we drive the enterprise to the ground? Well, we can! In this book, I will show you techniques that will help you to deliver the most impactful code, code that makes you and your organization succeed.

## Deliver the result faster, on budget and time

Another reason for the 50% failure rate of IT projects is that developers take so long to deliver the result that the organization runs out of time and money. In many cases, the reason for the slow development time is the waste. The good thing is that you take the initiative to streamline your process and eliminate waste by using the practices and methodologies described in this book. Apply it to lead your team in delivering software faster than anyone else in the industry.
